	of a real world scene given several images of it. Recent major developments in the
	theory and practice of scene reconstruction are described in detail in a unified framework.
	The book covers the geometric principles and how to represent objects algebraically
	so they can be computed and applied. The authors provide comprehensive background
	material and explain how to apply the methods and implement the algorithms directly.}

However, the real interest and benefit of the research community is not easy to quantify. We analyse here the feedback on the Messidor database, after more than 6 years of diffusion.

	abstract={Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

	abstract = {We consider supervised learning in the presence of very many irrelevant features,
	and study two different regularization methods for preventing overfitting. Focusing
	on logistic regression, we show that using L1 regularization of the parameters, the
	sample complexity (i.e., the number of training examples required to learn "well,")
	grows only logarithmically in the number of irrelevant features. This logarithmic
	rate matches the best known bounds for feature selection, and indicates that L1 regularized
	logistic regression can be effective even if there are exponentially many irrelevant
	features as there are training examples. We also give a lower-bound showing that any
	rotationally invariant algorithm---including logistic regression with L2 regularization,
	SVMs, and neural networks trained by backpropagation---has a worst case sample complexity
	that grows at least linearly in the number of irrelevant features.},

	abstract = {The conventional wisdom is that backprop nets with excess hidden units generalize
	poorly. We show that nets with excess capacity generalize well when trained with backprop
	and early stopping. Experiments suggest two reasons for this: 1) Overfitting can vary
	significantly in different regions of the model. Excess capacity allows better fit
	to regions of high non-linearity, and backprop often avoids overfitting the regions
	of low non-linearity. 2) Regardless of size, nets learn task subcomponents in similar
	sequence. Big nets pass through stages similar to those learned by smaller nets. Early
	stopping can stop training the large net when it generalizes comparably to a smaller
	net. We also show that conjugate gradient can yield worse generalization because it
	overfits regions of low non-linearity when learning to fit regions of high non-linearity.},
